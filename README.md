# catimg

Print an image of a cat from imgur to iTerm2.

Uses iTerm2's proprietary escape codes and Imgur to display an image of a cat
in your terminal.

NOTE: I do not own the images that you see, nor have I any control over
them. You will see some image that is tagged as "cat" on Imgur. That could be
anything. We do filter out images that are tagged NSFW, but there are no
guarantees that you won't see something you wish you hadn't. Use at your own
risk.
